ACTIVATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR MINGW64
===================================

Since you're using MinGW64 on Windows, here are the correct commands:

1. ACTIVATE THE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT:
   
   Option A (Recommended for MinGW64):
   $ . transformer_env/Scripts/activate
   
   Option B (Also works):
   $ source transformer_env/Scripts/activate
   
   Option C (If above don't work):
   $ transformer_env/Scripts/activate.bat

2. VERIFY ACTIVATION:
   You should see (transformer_env) in your prompt.
   
   Test with:
   $ which python
   Should show: /c/Users/jcbcl/annotyTransformer/transformer_env/Scripts/python

3. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES:
   $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   $ pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
   $ pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib tqdm

4. TEST THE INSTALLATION:
   $ python simple_demo.py

5. TO DEACTIVATE LATER:
   $ deactivate

COMMON ISSUES ON MINGW64:
- If 'source' doesn't work, use the dot notation: . transformer_env/Scripts/activate
- The Scripts folder (not bin) contains the executables on Windows
- Use forward slashes (/) not backslashes (\) in MinGW64
